# Pillars-of-ML

Proficiency in machine learning algorithms necessitates a profound understanding of foundational mathematical disciplines, specifically linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory.

Within this repository, a comprehensive exploration of machine learning algorithms will be undertaken, focusing on three principal facets aligned with the aforementioned mathematical domains.

Algorithms covered:
1. Linear & Polynomial Regression 
2. Logistic Regression
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Decision Trees & Random Forest
5. Locality Sensitive Hashing
6. K Nearest Neighbors (Classifiers & Regressor)
7. Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, CCA, LDA, Auto-Encoder)
