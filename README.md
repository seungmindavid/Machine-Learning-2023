# Pillars-of-ML

Proficiency in machine learning algorithms necessitates a profound understanding of foundational mathematical disciplines, specifically linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory.

Within this repository, a comprehensive exploration of machine learning algorithms will be undertaken, focusing on three principal facets aligned with the aforementioned mathematical domains.

Algorithms covered:
1. Linear & Polynomial Regression 
2. Logistic Regression
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Decision Trees & Random Forest
5. Locality Sensitive Hashing - Random projection
6. K Nearest Neighbors (Classifiers & Regressor)
7. Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, LDA, Auto-Encoder, CCA)
8. Clustering (K-Means Clustering)
9. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Expectation Maximization (EM) Algorithms
10. Spectral Clustering
11. Generative Modeling (GAN)
12. Diffusion Model
13. Deep Learning
